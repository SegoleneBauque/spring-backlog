# SprintBacklog

This project represents a sprint Backlog. With this application, you can do the following:
 - create Product Backlog Items (PBI),
 - within each PBI you can add the different required tasks to achieve the delivery of the PBI,
 - for each task created, you can create its acceptance criterias.
 
 On the Homepage, you can visualize the different PBIS and track the advancement of each task as regards to their state so all the team members know where they stand.
 
 You can also access the the details of a task to update its status, check the acceptance criterias when needed, put a task back to WIP when at least one acceptance criteria is not fullfilled for instance.
